		<p> Lovejoy was founded by William Gold and Joe Goldsmith in 2021. The two met from previously playing in the same folk group.  Gold previously gained a following online for his Twitch streams and YouTube videos, as well as his solo music. The band was originally called "Hang the DJ". The current name is after Benedict Lovejoy, a friend of the band, who would sit with them during their early days of songwriting.

Before joining Lovejoy, drummer Mark Boardman had been studying editing at university, bass guitarist Ash Kabosu was working in TV broadcasting, and lead guitarist Joe Goldsmith was a tree surgeon. Gold met Kabosu, a friend of a friend, in a Smashburger shop in Brighton, and asked him if he'd like to join the band. During studio recording, the band hired Boardman on Fiverr, and after watching him perform, Gold invited him to join as a permanent member.

The band recorded their debut EP, Are You Alright?, in two days at Brighton Electric in March 2021. It was released on 8 May 2021, which saw Lovejoy debut at number 10 on Billboard's Emerging Artists chart on 20 May 2021.

Their second EP, Pebble Brain, was recorded in August 2021 at Small Pond Recording Studios in Brighton, and released on 14 October 2021. The EP peaked at number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. The songs of this EP had the theme of failed romantic relationships, but also expand to political unrest. In October 2022, the band issued their first two EPs, as well as their cover of "Knee Deep at ATP", to vinyl for the first time.

Prior to their large concert and festival performances, Lovejoy performed unadvertised gigs under pseudonyms. From November 2022, the band began to receive attention on mainstream radio, with airtime on BBC Radio 1, and on Dutch radio show "Welkom Bij De Club!" (transl. Welcome to the Club!). Their songs have also been featured on BBC Music Introducing.</p>
